## ABOUT THE PROJECT  

It handles arithmetic operations seamlessly with support for number and decimal inputs  
Basic operations  
Smart result formatting  
Interactive prompt for user input  
overflow safe and it's panic free.  

---------------------------------  

## WHAT'S INSIDE?
main.rs -- The entry point of the calculator program and the composer of this math orchestra.  
calculator.rs -- Contains the math logic.  
utils.rs -- optional but necessary module for input parsing and error handling.  
cargo.toml -- Handles the project metadata & dependencies.  
.gitignore -- This ignores files like /target/ folder and other compiled artifacts.  

--------------------------------

## TECHNOLOGIES:  
Rust(safe, fast, and fun).  
Standard library only == no external dependencies.  

-------------------------------

## HOW TO RUN IT:  
First, make sure you’ve got [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust_calculator.git  
cd rust_calculator  
cargo run 

------------------------------

## WHY IS THIS PROGRAM IMPORTANT?  
Because sometimes as a Rustacean you just want to build something simple and cool in Rust that assists the maths chao and doesn't involve setting up a web server, a database, or taming wild lifetimes atleast for now lol. This project also represents my roadmap for teaching and deeper understanding of Rust.  

-----------------------------

## FUTURE UPDATES:  
Power (^)  
Square roots  
Modulo operations  

------------------------------

## FINAL THOUGHTS:
This program 'rust calculator' doesn’t try to be fancy. It just gets the job done, by crunching those arithemetic operators and giving you memory space to worry about the price of Bitcoin. Also, kind of like duct tape but with less stickiness and more basic math.  

Pull requests welcome. Typos encouraged, blame the chars!
